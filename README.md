## Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Concepts

[![Run on Repl.it](https://hall500-advancednode.abdullahmomoh.repl.co/)](https://hall500-advancednode.abdullahmomoh.repl.co/)

We continue on the path of exploring [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) functionality including working with middleware packages in our Express Application.

Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process. This application utilizes this key concept.

The most common and easiest way to use authentication middleware for Node.js is [PassportJS](https://passportjs.org/). It is easy to learn, light-weight, and extremely flexible allowing for many strategies. We also explore template engines, specifically [PugJS](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), and web sockets, [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). Web sockets allow for real time communication between all your clients and your server. Working on these challenges involved writing code on Repl.it using freecodecamp starter project.
